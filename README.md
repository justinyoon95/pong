# pong
Pong game made back in 2020 as the final Processing Project in Computer Programming 12.
The Program will probably not work as it should now as it was optimized for a Macintosh screen. 
I will be updating it so it is compatible with all types of screens.

(It probably has screen resolution issues on your pc. I'll make an update when I have time. The code is also very messy, so I may have to renovate it.
